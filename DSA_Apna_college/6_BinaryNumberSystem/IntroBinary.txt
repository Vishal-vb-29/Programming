//Binary Number System

A binary number system is a number system that is used to represent various numbers using only two symbols “0” and “1”. 

The word binary is derived from the word “bi” which means two. Hence, this number system is called the Binary Number System. Thus, the binary number system is a system that has only two symbols.

//Types of Number System

There are generally various types of number systems and among them the four major ones are,

Binary Number System (Number system with Base 2)
Octal Number System (Number system with Base 8)
Decimal Number System (Number system with Base 10)
Hexadecimal Number System (Number system with Base 16)

In a binary number system, we represent the number as,

(11001)2


// Binary to Decimal Conversion

A binary number is converted into a decimal number by multiplying each digit of the binary number by the power of either 1 or 0 to the corresponding power of 2. Let us consider that a binary number has n digits, B = an-1…a3a2a1a0. Now, the corresponding decimal number is given as

D = (an-1 × 2n-1) +…+(a3 × 23) + (a2 × 22) + (a1 × 21) + (a0 × 20)


Convert (10011)2 to a decimal number.

Solution:

The given binary number is (10011)2.

(10011)2 = (1 × 24) + (0 × 23) + (0 × 22) + (1 × 21) + (1 × 20)

= 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = (19)10

Hence, the binary number (10011)2 is expressed as (19)10.

// Decimal to Binary Conversion

A decimal number is converted into a binary number by dividing the given decimal number by 2 continuously until we get the quotient as 1, and we write the numbers from downwards to upwards.

Let us go through an example to understand the concept better.

Example: Convert (28)10 into a binary number.
