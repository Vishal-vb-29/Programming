Vectors : 
Array like but it is a dynamic(resize) in nature (i.e. dont have a fixed size, it increases as needed )

STL : Standard Template Library
Tool Box : already have a Implementation of data structures.

STL Containers : Vector, Queue, Stack, Set.

Vector Syntax
Must have to #includ e<vector>

vector<int> vec; //Size is 0;
vector<int> vec={1,2,3};
vector<int> vec(3,0);

for each loop in vector:

for(int val:vec) cout<<val<<endl;

Vector Functions :
# size
# push_back
# pop_back
# front
# back
# at
# capacity


Static v/s Dynamic Allocation

Static Allocation : allocation done at compile time. 
                    allocation is inside stack memory    

Dynamic Allocation : allocation done at runtime.
                     allocation is inside heap memory.


size v/s capacity
size : no of elements.
capacity : total no of element that can be stored.
