Arrays :

1st Data Strucutre, used to store data in an efficient way.
only store same type of data.
Contiguous memory.
linear data sructure.
indexing is start from 0.


Creation of Array:
<<< int marks[5];                   without initialization
<<< int marks[5]={12,15,18,17,19};  with initialization.

Accesssign an elemenet in array.
<<< cout<<marks[2]<<endl;  18
<<< cout<marks[4]<<endl;   19
<<< cout<<marks[6]<<endl;      error past end of the array (out of bound)
<<< cout<<marks[-1]<<endl      error before beginning of the array (out of bound)

Size of an array 
given in variable 
or using inbuilt function 
int sz = sizeof(marks)/sizeof(int);


Pass by Reference
giving a address of any variable to functions using parameters. 
changes are reflected in original array or variable as it is not a copy.
